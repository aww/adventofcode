# Advent of Code

## What I'm doing here

I'm a very casual participant in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com),
though I would love to fill all of this out with my own complete solutions.
If I go above and beyond simply getting answers it is almost entirely to improve the readability and reliablity of the code.

The language will remain Python for now, but I have my eye on a few different languages I'd like to try out.
Maybe one will eventually appear here.

I barely started [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/)

A majority of [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) is done,
but I was somewhat stuck on the second part of day 18 when I got busy with other things. 

As of this update I am just starting on [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/).
