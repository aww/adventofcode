# Advent of Code

## What I'm doing here

I'm a very casual participant in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).
I provide all my code here publicaly, mostly because "why not?".
My inputs are kept private per the conditions of the AoC.


The language will remain Python for now, but I have my eye on a few different languages I'd like to try out.
This would certainly be a good way to pratice with them.
Maybe one will eventually appear here.

## Philosophy

1. I am not trying to code super quickly.
1. I may start with a brute-force solution but will try to optmize anything that takes longer than a second or two.
1. I am not trying to be fancy here.
   If I go above and beyond simply getting answers it is almost entirely to improve the readability and reliablity of the code.
1. I am trying to work in a clean and organized way.
   This means using pytest, doing mildly test-driven coding, adding type hints, and running everything through `black`, `mypy`, and `flake8`.
1. All the imports needed for solutions must be from the Python standard library.
   This means I might use `bisect` for making an efficent search of a list but I will implement more specialist algorithms myself.
   There will be some dependencies for development such as automatically pulling inputs, building boilerplate, testing, and linting.


## Status

### 2020

My first year was [2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) and I barely started it.

### 2023

A majority of [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) is done,
but I was somewhat stuck on the second part of day 18 when I got busy with other things.

### 2024

I've gotten to day 12 of [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/).

### 2025

As of this update I am on day 6 of [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/).
The shorted schedule means I am resolved to do it all this year.
